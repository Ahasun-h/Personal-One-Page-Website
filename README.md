# Personal One Page Website

# Features

* All non-media elements in the HTML5 spec are included on one page and are ready to be styled.
* Modular Structure - add your own patterns, or delete the ones you don't like.
* Semantic and accessible markup examples for common design patterns.
* Thoroughly commented code (notes and reference links for new HTML developers)

# Getting the Code

* Create a new repo for your project on Github
* In terminal run
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/html.git yourNewRepoName
    cd [yourNewRepoName]
    git remote rm origin
    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git
    git remote -v
```

* git remote -v will allow you to check that you have changed the remote origin correctly. The output should look like:
```bash
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (push)
```

Now you're set up to use this in a new project.
